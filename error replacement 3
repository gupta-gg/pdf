9.)Write a query to display customer id, customer name, card id, card description and card 
amount in dollars of customers who have taken movie on the same day the library card is 
registered. For Example Assume John registered a library card on 12th Jan 2013 and he took a 
movie on 12th Jan 2013 then display his details. AMOUNT_DOLLAR = amount/52.42 and 
round it to zero decimal places and display as $Amount. Example Assume 500 is the amount 
then dollar value will be $10. Hint: Use AMOUNT_DOLLAR as alias name for amount in dollar. 
Display the records in ascending order based on customer name.



SELECT c.CUSTOMER_ID,c.CUSTOMER_NAME,l.card_id,l.DESCRIPTION,
concat('$',round(amount/52.42)) AMOUNT_DOLLAR FROM
customer_master c JOIN customer_issue_details ci ON c.customer_id=ci.customer_id
JOIN customer_card_details cc ON cc.customer_id=c.customer_id
JOIN library_card_master l ON cc.card_id=l.card_id
WHERE cc.issue_date=ci.issue_date
ORDER BY customer_name;
