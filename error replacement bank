1.)Write a query to show the branch name,branch city where we have the maximum customers. For 
example the branch B00019 has 3 customers, B00020 has 7 and B00021 has 10. So branch id B00021 is 
having maximum customers. If B00021 is Koramangla branch Bangalore, Koramangla branch should 
be displayed along with city name Bangalore. In case of multiple records, display the records sorted in 
ascending order based on branch name.


SELECT b.branch_name,b.branch_city FROM
Branch_master b JOIN account_master a ON a.branch_id=b.branch_id
GROUP BY a.branch_id HAVING count(a.customer_number)>=ALL
(SELECT count(customer_number) FROM 
Account_master GROUP BY branch_id)
ORDER BY b.branch_name;

2.) Display the customer number, customer's first name, account number and number of transactions 
being made by the customers from each account. Give the alias name for number of transactions as 
Count_Trans. Display the records sorted in ascending order based on customer number and then by 
account number.


SELECT c.customer_number,c.firstname,t.account_number, count(t.account_number) Count_Trans 
FROM transaction_details t JOIN account_master a ON a.account_number=t.account_number
JOIN customer_master c ON c.customer_number=a.customer_number
GROUP BY t.account_number ORDER BY c.customer_number, a.account_number;


3.) Write a query to display the customer number, firstname, lastname for those client where total 
loan amount taken is maximum and at least taken from 2 branches. For example the customer C00012 
took a loan of 100000 from bank branch with id B00009 and C00012 Took a loan of 500000 from bank 
branch with id B00010. So total loan amount for customer C00012 is 600000. C00013 took a loan of 
100000 from bank branch B00009 and 200000 from bank branch B00011. So total loan taken is 
300000. So loan taken by C00012 is more then C00013.


SELECT ld.customer_number, firstname, lastname
FROM customer_master cm JOIN loan_details ld
ON cm.customer_number=ld.customer_number
GROUP BY customer_number
HAVING count(branch_id)>=2 AND sum(loan_amount)>=
ALL(SELECT sum(loan_amount) FROM loan_details GROUP BY customer_number);
